        <p style="color: darkred;">Welcome. The questions in this quiz have all been inspired by the people in our
            discord community and all the fun stuff that goes on in there.</p>
        <p style="color: darkblue">It will be fast paced, but lots of the questions are multiple choice, so take a guess and don't worry if you
            can't get them all. There will be lots of chances to get points later, there's something for everyone!</p>
        <p style="color:darkred">Since we have a lot to get through, we won't be able to keep an eye on chat. Make sure you've got your printed answer sheet or a scrap of paper and a pen ready, then let's go!</p>
